The committee charged with developing Fibre Channel technology 
was established within the American National Standards Institute 
(ANSI) in 1989. The original goal was to establish a connectivity 
technology with a serial interface and carried over fiber optic 
lines. Unlike other technologies, Fibre Channel was being developed 
as a standard long before the first products were manufactured. 
<P> 
To assist in ensuring the interoperability among products and 
to kick-start the market for Fibre Channel technology, three of 
the biggest players -- IBM, Hewlett-Packard Co., and Sun Microsystems 
Inc. -- formed what came to be known as the Fibre Channel Systems 
Initiative (FCSI) in 1991. From the beginning, FCSI was designed 
to be a temporary organization. Its duties were later handed over 
to the larger Fibre Channel Association in 1995. 
<P> 
One of the goals of FCSI was to develop a half-dozen &quot;profiles&quot; 
of the technology for different applications. The profiles were 
more specific versions of the ANSI standard. The goal of the profiles 
was to ensure the highest possible level of interoperability among 
Fibre Channel products.  
<P> 
Fibre Channel was accepted as an ANSI standard in 1994.  Fibre 
Channel was first publicly demonstrated at the NetWorld+Interop 
trade show in Atlanta in September 1995.<BR> 
<P> 
<B><FONT SIZE=4>What is Fibre Channel?</FONT></B> 
<P> 
Data communication generally takes place on channels or networks. 
 A channel provides a direct or switched point-to-point connection 
between the communicating devices. A channel is typically hardware 
intensive and transports data at the high speed with low overhead. 
In contrast, a network is an aggregation of distributed nodes 
(like workstations, file servers, or peripherals) with its own 
protocol that supports interaction among these nodes. A network 
has a relatively high overhead since it is software intensive 
and, consequently, slower than a channel. Networks can handle 
a more extensive range of tasks than channels as they operate 
in an environment of unanticipated connections, while channels 
operate amongst only a few devices with predefined addresses. 
Fibre Channel attempts to combine the best of these two methods 
of communication into a new I/O interface that meets the needs 
of both channel and network users. 
<P> 
Fibre Channel is a general name for the integrated set of standards 
being developed by ANSI (see Table 1).  Fibre Channel's purpose 
is to provide a means for the high-speed transfer of data in a 
serial link between supercomputers, mainframes, workstations, 
desktop computers, storage devices, displays, and other peripherals. 
 The Fibre Channel protocol does not have its own command set; 
 it simply manages the data transfer between nodes and thus interoperates 
with existing upper-level protocols.<BR>

A Fibre Channel installation has a minimum of one link between 
two nodes.  The data flows between hardware entities called N_ports, 
generally part of the termination card which contains hardware 
and software support for the Fibre Channel protocol.  Each node 
must have at least one N_port, and usually has two; either may 
serve as transmitter, receiver, or both.  An N_port is assigned 
a unique address (the N_port Identifier), and also contains a 
Link Control Facility (LCF), that handles the logical and physical 
control of the link at the firmware level. 
<P> 
Fibre Channel allows for an active intelligent interconnection 
scheme, called a Fabric, to connect devices. Everything between 
the ports on Fibre Channel is called the Fabric.  The Fabric is 
most often a switch or series of switches  that takes the responsibility 
for routing.  Ports on the Fabric are called F_ports.  All a Fibre 
Channel node has to do is to manage a simple point-to-point connection 
between itself (N_port) and the Fabric (F_port).  NL_port and 
FL_port refer to an N_port and F_port, respectively, that can 
support arbitrated loop functions in addition to basic point-to-point 
functions. 
<P> 
The Fibre Channel system relies on ports logging in with each 
other and the Fabric; so the Fabric can be a circuit switch, an 
active hub, or a loop.   Fibre Channel allows for three different 
topologies: 
<OL> 
<LI><B>POINT-TO-POINT</B> 
<UL> 
<LI>Simplest topology 
<LI>Utilizes bidirectional links that interconnect the N_ports 
of a pair of nodes 
<LI>Non-blocking 
<LI>Underutilizes of the bandwidth of the communications link 
<BR> 
</UL> 
<LI><B>ARBITRATED LOOP</B> 
<UL> 
<LI>Is basically the simplest form of  a Fabric topology. 
<LI>Has shared bandwidth, distributed topology. 
<LI>Interconnects NL_ports/FL_ports at the nodes/Fabric using 
unidirectional links. 
<LI>Only one active L_port-L_port connection, so blocking is possible. 
<LI>A fairness algorithm ensures that no L_port is blocked from 
accessing the loop. 
<LI>Should any link in the loop fail, communication between all 
L_ports is terminated. 
<LI>Does not need a switched Fabric, so less expensive than cross-point. 
<BR> 
</UL> 
<LI><B>CROSS-POINT (OR FABRIC SWITCHED)</B> 
<UL> 
<LI>Links provide a bidirectional connection between a node (N_port) 
and the Fabric (F_port). 
<LI>Can be configured to be non-blocking by providing multiple 
paths between any two F_ports. 
<LI>Uses a Destination_Identifier (D_ID), embedded in the frame 
header, to route the frame through the Fabric to the desired destination 
N_port. 
<LI>Provides the highest performance and connectivity of the three 
topologies. 
<LI>Provides efficient sharing of available bandwidth. 
<LI>Connectivity is guaranteed without congestion. 
<LI>Adding stations to a Fabric does not reduce the point-to-point 
channel bandwidth. 
<LI>Generic Fabric requirements are defined in the FC-FG standard. 
<LI>Switch Fabric characteristics are defined in the FC-SW standard. 
</UL> 
</OL> 
<P> 
The topology of the Fibre Channel network is transparent to the 
attached devices.  The Fibre Channel ports involved in a given 
link negotiate the means and nature of the connection or transmission. 
 All topologies are fully interoperable. Fibre Channel switch 
ports (also known as fabric ports or F_ports) can provide individual 
end-stations (N_ports) or loops access to the overall Fibre Channel 
network.  
<P> 
All point-to-point and arbitrated loop topologies require that 
all nodes use the same data rate at all times. In a Fibre Channel 
switch topology, however, dynamic rate conversion is possible. 
For example, in the switched topology, a 266-Mbaud unit could 
connect to a 1.062-Gbaud unit. The two ports involved in the connection 
simply negotiate the lowest available data rate for information 
transport while each link maintains its own line rate. 
<P> 
If traditional networking components, such as switches and hubs, 
are added to the storage infrastructure, then multiple servers 
can be connected with multiple storage devices.   Fibre Channel's 
flexibility allows for the introduction of a much more modular 
building block type of architecture, that can be tuned more toward 
specific applications.<FONT SIZE=2> <BR> 
</FONT> 
<P> 
<B><FONT SIZE=4>Fibre Channel Structure:<BR> 
<BR> 
</FONT></B>Fibre Channel is structured as a set of hierarchical 
functions, similar to the ISO OSI Reference Model.  There are 
five layers, pictured in Figure 1. 
<P> 
<CENTER><IMG SRC=".\ov2.gif" HEIGHT=282 WIDTH=472></CENTER> 
<P> 
<CENTER><B>Figure 1.  Fibre Channel Structure<BR> 
</B></CENTER> 
<P> 
The three bottom layers of the Fibre Channel stack (FC-0 through 
FC-2) form what is known as the Fibre Channel physical standard 
(FC-PH). This defines all the physical transmission characteristics 
of Fibre Channel. The remaining layers (FC-3 and FC-4) handle 
interfaces with other network protocols and applications. 
<P> 
Unlike Local Area Network (LAN) technologies such as Ethernet 
and token ring, Fibre Channel keeps the various functional layers 
of the stack physically separate. This enables vendors to build 
products from discrete functional components-such as chip sets 
and bus interfaces-that handle specific portions of the protocol 
stack. It also allows them to implement some stack functions in 
hardware and others in software or firmware. <BR> 
<BR> 
<P> 
<B>FC-0 Layer:  Physical Layer</B> 
<P> 
FC-0 defines the basic physical link, including the fibre, connectors, 
and optical/electrical parameters for a variety of data rates. 
Fibre Channel offers a basic rate of 133 Mbaud, the most commonly 
used speed of 266 Mbaud, as well as 531 Mbaud and 1.062 Gbaud. 
 It is important to note that these signaling rates include the 
overhead involved in establishing and maintaining connections. 
The actual data throughput is somewhat lower: 100 Mbit/s for 133 
Mbaud, 200 Mbit/s for 266 Mbaud, 400 Mbit/s for 531 Mbaud, and 
800 Mbit/s for 1.062 Gbaud.  
<P> 
Data rates are expected to go well beyond today's 1.062-Gbaud 
ceiling. In most cases, including switched environments, users 
will be able to upgrade simply by swapping in an adapter card. 
Specifications for 2.134 and 4.268 Gbaud are already in place. 
<P> 
<B>FC-1 Layer:  Transmission Encode/Decode Layer</B> 
<P> 
FC-1 defines the transmission protocol including serial encoding 
and decoding rules, special characters, timing recovery, and error 
control. The information transmitted over a fibre is encoded 8 
bits at a time into a 10-bit Transmission Character (8B/10B transmission 
coding scheme licensed from IBM). The two extra bits are used 
for error detection and correction, known as disparity control. 
The 8B/10B scheme supplies sufficient error detection and correction 
to permit use of low-cost transceivers, as well as timing recovery 
methods to reduce the risk of radio frequency interference and 
ensure balanced, synchronized transmissions. 
<P> 
<B>FC-2 Layer:  Framing and Signaling Layer</B> 
<P> 
The FC-2 layer performs the basic signaling and framing functions 
and defines the transport mechanism for data from the upper layers 
of the stack (see Figure 2).  
<P> 
FC-2 frames and sequences data from the upper layers for transmission 
via the FC-0 layer. It also accepts transmissions from the FC-0 
layer and reframes and resequences them for use by the upper layers. 
Fibre Channel frame sizes can vary and must be negotiated by the 
transmitter/receiver pair for each connection. Frame sizes typically 
range from 36 bytes to 2 kB, but may be larger in some cases.

<P>

<P> 
<CENTER><B>Figure 2.  Frame Structure</B> </CENTER> 
<TABLE> 
<TR><TD WIDTH=638><I><FONT SIZE=2>The amount of overhead required to transmit a frame remains constant regardless of frame size. This makes Fibre Channel very efficient for high volume data transfers, such as storage reads and writes or TCP/IP file exchanges.</FONT></I> 
</TD></TR> 
</TABLE> 
<P> 
FC-2 signaling defines the connection between at least two Fibre 
Channel node ports (or N_ports). One of these must act as the 
originator of outbound traffic, and at least one other must act 
as a responder, receiving inbound traffic and sending traffic 
back. Connections between N_ports are full duplex.  The FC-2 layer 
also provides essential traffic management functions, including 
flow control, link management, buffer memory management, as well 
as error detection and correction. 
<P> 
Finally, FC-2 supplies additional flow control and error correction 
mechanisms. For flow control, it employs a sliding window scheme 
similar to that of TCP/IP.  Flow control functionality varies 
somewhat according to the class of service defined. Error detection 
is performed using a 32-bit CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check). A Link 
Control Facility (LCF) manages the Fibre Channel connection and 
maintains the information needed to recover links in the event 
of failure.  
<H3><A NAME="_Toc410717796">Service Classes</A> </H3> 
<P> 
FC-2 also defines four classes of service, a unique feature of 
Fibre Channel that allows it to meet a variety of communications 
needs.  The user selects a service class based on the characteristics 
of their application, such as packet length and transmission duration, 
and allocates the services by the Fabric login protocol.  The 
four classes are as follows: 
<P> 
<EM>Class 1</EM>&nbsp;--    Hard-wired or circuit-switched connections; 
dedicated, uninterruptible links, like telephone connections. 
<UL> 
<LI>Connection is retained and guaranteed by the Fabric. 
<LI>Guarantees the maximum bandwidth between two N_ports 
<LI>Frames are delivered to the destination Port in the same order 
as they are transmitted 
<LI>Best for sustained, high throughput transactions 
<LI>Designed for time-critical, non-bursty, dedicated connections, 
such as those between two supercomputers.   
</UL> 
<P> 
<EM>Class 2</EM>&nbsp;--    Connectionless; frame-switched transmission; 
guarantees delivery; confirms receipt of traffic.  
<UL> 
<LI>Functions are performed on the data frame rather than on a 
connection. 
<LI>No dedicated connection is established between N_ports. 
<LI>Each frame is sent to its destination over any available route. 
<LI>There is no guarantee of the order of the delivery of frames. 
<LI>When congestion occurs, the frame is retransmitted until it 
successfully reaches its destination.  
<LI>When Class 2 signaling blocks a frame, the transmitting N_port 
receives a busy frame. This allows retransmission to be performed 
immediately, rather than forcing the station to wait, as is the 
case with TCP/IP and other protocols.  
</UL> 
<P> 
<EM>Class 3</EM>&nbsp;--   One-to-many connectionless, frame-switched 
service.  
<UL> 
<LI>Is similar to Class 2 service but has no delivery guarantee 
or confirmation mechanism. 
<LI>Is faster than Class 2 because there is no wait for confirmation. 
<LI>If a transmission does not arrive at its destination, Class 
3 service does not retransmit.  
<LI>This service is most often used for real-time broadcasts that 
cannot wait for acknowledgment but are not sufficiently time-critical 
to warrant Class 1 service.  
<LI>Is also used for applications that can tolerate lost packets. 
</UL> 
<P> 
<EM>Intermix</EM>&nbsp;--  An option of Class 1 service, in which 
Class 1 Frames are guaranteed a special amount of bandwidth, but 
Class 2 and Class 3 Frames are multiplexed onto the channel when 
the Class 1 connection is idle.<BR> 
<P> 
<B>FC-3 Layer:  Advanced Features</B> 
<P> 
The FC-3 layer defines special service features including:  
<UL> 
<LI>Striping -  Used to multiply bandwidth using multiple N_ports 
in parallel to transmit a single information unit across multiple 
links.  
<LI>Hunt groups -  Provides the ability for more than one port 
to respond to the same alias address. This improves efficiency 
by decreasing the chance of reaching a busy N_port.  
<LI>Multicast -  delivers a single transmission to multiple destination 
ports. This includes sending to all N_ports on a Fabric (broadcast) 
or to only a subset of the N_ports on a Fabric. <BR> 
</UL> 
<P> 
<B>FC-4 Layer:  Protocol Mapping</B> 
<P> 
This layer specifies the mapping rules for several legacy upper-layer 
protocols. FC-4 allows Fibre Channel to carry data from other 
networking protocols and applications.  Fibre Channel can concurrently 
transport both network and channel information over the same physical 
interface.  The following network and channel protocols are currently 
specified or proposed as FC-4:  
<UL> 
<LI>Small Computer System Interface (SCSI)  
<LI>Intelligent Peripheral Interface (IPI)  
<LI>High Performance Parallel Interface (HIPPI) Framing Protocol 
<LI>Internet Protocol (IP)  
<LI>ATM Adaptation Layer for computer data (AAL5)  
<LI>Link Encapsulation (FC-LE)  
<LI>Single Byte Command Code Set Mapping (SBCCS)  
<LI>IEEE 802.2  
</UL> 
<P> 
<P> 
<B>Physical Layer Mediums:</B> 
<P> 
Fibre Channel provides physical layer specifications for copper 
wire, coaxial wire, multi-mode fiber, and single-mode fiber.  
All physical layer mediums support the same maximum transfer rate 
of 1 Gbps.  The only restriction is the distance that each medium 
can be run over.<BR>
