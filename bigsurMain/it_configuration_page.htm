<p align="center"><img border="0" src="gifs/hp_4100_printer.gif" width="170" height="136"></p>
<p align="left">We are connecting to the printer directly using TCP/IP.&nbsp;
Currently, there is no unix server to spool to the printer. And, that's
fine.&nbsp; The print jobs are spooled up on your Windows 2000 Professional PC
and transferred via a TCP/IP port to the EIO network card on the HP 4100N
printer. Maybe more than you wanted to know.</p>
<p align="left">How to do it? Here are the steps..</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Open the Printers folder from the control panel</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Now top left do FILE and then select SERVER PROPERTIES</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Select the PORTS tab.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Click ADD PORTS</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Highlight Standard TCP/IP Port by clicking the mouse ONCE on
    it.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Now click once on NEW PORT - TCP/IP Wizard presents itself</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Click on NEXT</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">For printer name or IP address use this IP address: <b>10.1.2.1</b></li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">For Port name use HP LJ 4100N</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Click on NEXT</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Now CLOSE or FINISH</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Next phase - Get the HP printer driver onto your computer by
    clicking <a href="HP%204100%20Printer/lj828en.exe">[HERE]&nbsp; DOWNLOAD HP
    4100N driver</a> (!! For Windows 2000 ONLY !!) For Windows ME, see next
    article below.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Save the driver to somewhere on your hard drive where you
    will remember where you put it.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Find where you put the file on your hard drive and rapidly
    click twice on it with the mouse.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">The driver packed exe file will expand and unzip its
    contents to lj828en on your C:\ drive.&nbsp; That's OK, just remember where
    that is. So, all the driver files for the printer are now at <a href="file:///C:/lj828en">C:\lj828en</a>
    on your C:\ hard disk, OK?</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Now, go back to the control panel and find the Printers
    folder. Double click the folder to open it.</li>

    not allow &quot;Automatically detect ...&quot; or &quot;network
    printer&quot; to be selected.. </b>(whew - thanks)</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Now NEXT with the mouse.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">A list of ports is presented. <b>Make sure &quot;Use
    following port&quot; is selected. </b></li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">From the list of ports, find the port you made in step 8
    above.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Highlight port called &quot;HP LJ 4100N&quot; which is near
    the end of the list. </li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Now you see a bunch of names of printers presented.&nbsp;
    Not to worry. You have the printer driver and that will automatically figure
    out the name of the printer - so you don't have to.. <b>Select &quot;HAVE
    DISK&quot;.</b></li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Install from Disk menu comes up. Remember that disk path I
    told you to remember? Put <b><a href="file:///C:/lj828en">C:\lj828en</a> </b>into
    the &quot;Copy Manu files from&quot; area. and hit NEXT</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Note the name of the printer driver it found from your

    Laserjet 4100 PCL 6&quot; if you want to.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Printer sharing - Do not share the printer. As you really
    don't need to. Everyone can get to the printer using the method contained in
    the summary just as you are doing now.. </li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">NEXT</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Print a TEST page - NO, do that later.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Whew - you are finished.. Select FINISH</li>

    Internet Explorer and try to print a test page.. Do a FILE then
    PRINT...&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you see the printer you just created - Click the
    mouse on it and click PRINT.</li>

<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="5">Windows 98 or ME on a laptop or
similar only</font></p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="gifs/hp_4100_printer.gif" width="170" height="136"></p>

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left">We have been relying on the Jetdirect EIO card in the HP 4100N
printer to supply us with a nice embedded print spooler.&nbsp; This works fine
for Windows2000 which supports the concept of an HP printer port.</p>

<p align="left">Windows 98 and Windows ME do not have these features.</p>

<p align="left">To use the printer from these systems, you can share the printer
from your windows 2000 Dell computer (or similar) and use the shared printer to
gain access. There are certain things you have to set up first.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Your laptop must be configured to use DHCP and it must get
    it's IP address automatically from our DHCP server.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">You must have the Windows 98 or Windows ME driver for the HP
    4100N on your laptop and ready to be used for installation.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">IMPORTANT!! This is the bugaboo. You typed in a username a
    long time ago when you first setup windows 98 or ME&nbsp; on your
    laptop.&nbsp; That username MUST BE the exact same one you use in your
    Windows 2000 computer.&nbsp; This then, establishes a trust relationship
    between the laptop and your Windows 2000 machine. Due to Win2000 using
    encrypted passwords (and the inability of windows ME) to use this feature,
    the way around this is keeping the usernames matching.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">You now share the printer on your Windows2000 machine. Give
    it a nice short descriptive name you can use for step 7.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">On your Windows 98 or ME machine, you go to the printers
    folder and select NEW PRINTER.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">You choose NETWORK printer.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">for the name of the network printer you type in this:&nbsp; <a href="file://nameofyourcomputer/nameofprinter">\\nameofyourcomputer\nameofprinter</a>
    Where name of your computer is the name which shows up in the BigSur
    workgroup. Name of the printer is the name the printer was given when you
    shared it in step 4.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">For the driver, you now select HAVE DISK and point the
    install program to the area of the driver where you put it when you
    downloaded and expanded it. Probably <a href="file:///C:/hpxxxen">C:\hp844en</a>,
    where 844 is some model number internal to Hewlett Packard. If you need the
    driver for Windows ME download it from the BigSur Web server by clicking <a href="HP%204100%20Printer/lj844en_ME.exe">HERE</a>.&nbsp;
    Once you download the driver, it is in zipped .exe form. Double click on it
    and it will expand to the directory as in step 8.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Now, keep answering questions and hitting NEXT until you get
    to Finish.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Make sure your main Windows 2000 computer is ON when you are
    trying to print from your other computer which we just setup.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Try a test print from Internet Explorer.</li>
