|  Notes                                                                                                | 
|  1  Absolute MSF address repeated in the header field of data blocks.                                 | 
|  2  The CD-ROM data mode is stored in the header of data tracks. This indicates that                  | 
|     the block is part of a data pre-gap or post-gap (null), that this is a data                       | 
|     block using the auxiliary field for L-EC symbols (ECC - CD-ROM data mode one),                    | 
|     or that this is a data block using the auxiliary field for user data (CD-ROM                      | 
|     data mode two).                                                                                   | 
|  3  Table of contents information is stored in the sub-channel of lead-in area.  The                  | 
|     lead-in area is coded as track zero. Track zero and the initial 150 sector pre-                   | 
|     -gap (or audio pause) are not accessible with logical addressing.                                 | 
|  4  Value stored in table of contents with zero tolerance.                                            | 
|  5  Exact value returned by READ TOC command.                                                         | 
|  6  Value stored in table of contents plus or minus 75 sectors.                                       | 
|  7  Value returned by READ TOC command plus or minus 75 blocks.                                       | 
|  8  Track relative MSF value decreases to 0 in pre-gap areas.                                         | 
|  9  Track relative logical addresses are negative in the pre-gap areas.                               | 
|     Pre-gap areas have index values of zero.                                                          | 
|  10  Minimum value returned by READ CD-ROM CAPACITY - exact value depends                             | 
|      on encoding of this track and the lead out track and whether this is                             | 
|      derived from the TOC data.                                                                       | 
|  11  Value returned by READ TOC command - exact if lead-out track is                                  | 
|      encoded as data, or plus or minus 75 blocks if encoded as audio.                                 | 
|  12  Value stored in table of contents -  exact if lead-out track is coded                            | 
|      as data, or plus or minus 75 blocks if coded as audio.                                           | 
|  13  Lead-out track number is defined as 0AAh.                                                        |
