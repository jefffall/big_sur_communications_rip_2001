The model for the write-once device is a variation on the optical memory model. Most of the aspects of a write-once device are similar to optical memory devices. The differences are summarized in this clause. <a name=13.1.1><h3>13.1.1 Logical blocks</h3>
Data may be written to a logical block only once. A subsequent write to a logical block already written may or may not be corrupted, depending on the implementation. Write-once physical media is non- volatile. <p>The updating of blocks (see <a href="WW21.htm">16.1</a>) is discouraged. SCSI write-once devices are intended to be archival in nature. Data at a logical block address is not expected to change once it is written. The update commands are not defined for this device type. Devices are not precluded from implementing the update function by this standard, though devices that require the update function should use the optical memory device type. <p>Devices may be able to determine the state of a logical block prior to access. These devices can determine whether a block is blank or written. This is useful in detecting previously written blocks, and preventing a destructive overwrite. This is also useful in finding blank areas for later writing. The MEDIUM SCAN command can be used to find blank and written areas prior to WRITE and READ access. <a name=13.1.2><h3>13.1.2 Initialization</h3>
The FORMAT UNIT command is not defined for write-once devices. Write- once media is shipped pre-formatted by the manufacturer and is ready for use when mounted. <a name=13.1.3><h3>13.1.3 Physical medium defects</h3>
The raw defect rate is typically higher for optical medium than for magnetic medium. Data is usually recovered through the use of sophisticated error correction algorithms. The level of error correction used for data recovery is often can be selected. However, many write-once devices have a minimum level that is always used and cannot be de-selected through the error recovery mode parameter. Control of the error correction algorithms and level of correction is vendor-specific. <p>Defect management on write-once devices is usually vendor-specific. However, there are standards for some types of write-once media that specify defect management techniques. These standards, where they exist, may supersede the implementation requirements pertaining to error and defect reporting in this International Standard. <a name=13.1.4><h3>13.1.4 Error reporting</h3>
If any of the following conditions occur during the execution of a command the target shall return CHECK CONDITION status. The appropriate sense key and additional sense code should be set. The following list illustrates some error conditions and the applicable sense keys. The list does not provide an exhaustive enumeration of all conditions that may cause the CHECK CONDITION status. <pre><b> Condition       Sense Key</b>
 Invalid logical block address           ILLEGAL REQUEST  

 Unsupported option requested            ILLEGAL REQUEST

 Attempt to write a previously 
 written block and blank 
 checking is enabled                     BLANK CHECK </pre><br>
In the case of an invalid logical block address, the sense data information field shall be set to the logical block address of the first invalid address. <p>In the case of an attempt to read a blank or previously unwritten block, the sense data information field shall be set to the logical block address of the first blank block encountered. The data read up to that block shall be transferred. <p>In the case of an attempt to write a previously written block and blank checking is enabled, the sense information field shall be set to the logical block address of the first non-blank block encountered. <a name=13.2><h2>13.2 Commands for write-once devices</h2>
