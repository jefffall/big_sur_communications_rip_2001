| 00h The maximum error recovery procedures available are used.  If an error   | 
|     occurs which is uncorrectable with the error correction codes (ECC) on   | 
|     the media, data transfer is terminated with CHECK CONDITION status. The  | 
|     block with the error is not transferred. The sense key is set to MEDIUM  | 
|     ERROR. The information bytes give the address of the block where the     | 
|     unrecovered error was detected. Recovered errors are not reported.       | 
|                                                                              | 
| 01h Only retries of the read operation and CIRC are used (layered error      | 
|     correction is not used). Only CIRC unrecovered data errors are reported. | 
|     If an CIRC unrecovered data error occurs, data transfer is terminated    | 
|     with CHECK CONDITION status.  The block with the error is not            | 
|     transferred. The sense key is set to MEDIUM ERROR. The information bytes | 
|     give the address of the block where the unrecovered error was detected.  | 
|     Recovered errors are not reported.                                       | 
|                                                                              | 
| 04h The maximum error recovery procedures available are used. Recovered data | 
|     errors are reported.  If a recovered data error occurs, data transfer is | 
|     not terminated.   However, when the data transfer has completed CHECK    | 
|     CONDITION status is reported.  The sense key is set to RECOVERED ERROR.  | 
|     The information bytes give the address of the last block where a         | 
|     recovered data error was detected.                                       | 
|                                                                              | 
|     If a data error occurs that is uncorrectable with the ECC information    | 
|     available on the media, data transfer is terminated and CHECK CONDITION  | 
|     status is reported. The block with the error is not transferred. The     | 
|     sense key is set to MEDIUM ERROR. The information bytes give the address | 
|     of the block where the uncorrectable error was detected.                 | 
|                                                                              | 
| 05h Only retries of the read operation and CIRC are used (layered error      | 
|     correction is not used).  Recovered data errors are reported.  If a      | 
|     recovered data error occurs, data transfer is not terminated.  However,  | 
|     when the data transfer has completed CHECK CONDITION status is reported. | 
|     The sense key is set to RECOVERED ERROR. The information bytes give the  | 
|     address of the last block where a CIRC recovered data error was          | 
|     detected.                                                                |

|     If an unrecovered data error occurs, data transfer is terminated and     | 
|     CHECK CONDITION status is reported. The block with the error is not      | 
|     transferred. The sense key is set to MEDIUM ERROR. The information bytes | 
|     give the address of the block where the unrecovered error was detected.  |

| 06h The maximum error recovery procedures are used. Recovered data errors    | 
|     are reported.  If a recovered data error occurs data transfer is         | 
|     terminated and CHECK CONDITION status is reported.  The block with the   | 
|     recovered error is not transferred. The sense key is set to RECOVERED    | 
|     ERROR.  The information bytes give the address of the block where the    |
