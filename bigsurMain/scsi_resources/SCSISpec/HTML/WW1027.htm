|   00b  |  SLEW AND PRINT commands with a channel bit of zero are supported  | 
|        |  without any required setup.                                       | 
|        |                                                                    | 
|   01b  |  SLEW AND PRINT commands with a channel bit of zero are only       | 
|        |  accepted after the initiator issues a FORMAT command with a format| 
|        |  type of set form (to initialize the electronic vertical forms     | 
|        |  unit).                                                            |

|   10b  |  SLEW AND PRINT commands with a channel bit of zero are always     | 
|        |  accepted.  The target shall use the electronic vertical forms unit| 
|        |  if it has previously been initialized or it shall initialize the  | 
|        |  electronic vertical forms unit for line skipping by sending the   | 
|        |  EVFU start format character immediately followed by the EVFU stop | 
|        |  format character (both are defined below) prior to executing the  | 
|        |  SLEW AND PRINT command.                                           |
