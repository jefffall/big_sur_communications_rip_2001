This Small Computer System Interface -2 standard is designed to provide an efficient peer-to-peer I/O bus with up to 16 devices, including one or more hosts. Data may be transferred asynchronously at rates that only depend on device implementation and cable length. Synchronous data transfers are supported at rates up to 10 mega-transfers per second. With the 32-bit wide data transfer option, data rates of up to 40 megabytes per second are possible. This standard includes command sets for magnetic and optical disks, tapes, printers, processors, CD-ROMs, scanners, medium changers, and communications devices. </body></html>
