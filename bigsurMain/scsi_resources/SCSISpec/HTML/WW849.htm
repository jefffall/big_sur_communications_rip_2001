|  0  |  0  | On inexact segments, it is device specific whether the COPY     | 
|     |     | manager rejects the COPY command with CHECK CONDITION status and| 
|     |     | ILLEGAL REQUEST sense key, the COPY manager writes or accepts   | 
|     |     | short blocks (variable-block mode on sequential-access devices),| 
|     |     | or the COPY manager adds pad characters (00h) to the destination| 
|     |     | block or strips pad characters from the source block.           | 
|     |     |                                                                 | 
|  1  |  0  | On inexact segments, the COPY manager shall add pad characters  | 
|     |     | (00h) to the destination block to completely fill the block, or | 
|     |     | it shall strip pad characters from the source block, always     | 
|     |     | stopping at the end of a complete block.                        | 
|     |     |                                                                 | 
|  X  |  1  | The COPY manager shall always write or read complete blocks.  On| 
|     |     | inexact segments, the remainder of the block contains data from | 
|     |     | the next segment.  This code is not valid in the last segment of| 
|     |     | the COPY command.                                               |
