This annex provides information on other formal standardization activities related to SCSI. <a name=C.1><h2>C.1 SCSI-3 standards projects </h2>
Accredited Standards Committee X3 has approved several SCSI-3 projects to enhance and restructure the SCSI-2 standard as shown in <a href="WW786.gif" target="figures">figure C.1</a>. These projects (except fibre channel) are assigned to the X3T9.2 Task Group which developed this International Standard and the SCSI-1 standard. Please contact the Chairman of X3T9.2 for further information concerning these projects. <a name=C.2><h2>C.2 Digital data exchange for colour electronic prepress systems </h2>
Accredited Standards Committee IT8 has developed several standards pertaining to the exchange of digital data between colour electronic prepress systems. These devices are used for high quality color printing. At least one of the IT8 projects involves transferring such data over SCSI. Please contact the Secretariat of IT8 for further information concerning their projects. <a name=C.3><h2>C.3 Fibre channel </h2>
Accredited Standards Committee X3 has approved a project to develop a fibre optic channel physical layer for the Intelligent Peripheral Interface (IPI), SCSI, and the High Performance Parallel Interface (HIPPI). This project is assigned to the X3T9.3 Task Group. Please contact the Chairman of X3T9.3 for further information concerning this project. <p><a name=figC.1><a href="WW786.gif" target="figures"><img src="WWR16.gif"><br>
