|   000b  |  The specified peripheral device type is currently connected to   | 
|         |  this logical unit.  If the target cannot determine whether or    | 
|         |  not a physical device is currently connected, it shall also use  | 
|         |  this peripheral qualifier when returning the INQUIRY data.       | 
|         |  This peripheral qualifier does not mean that the device is ready | 
|         |  for access by the initiator.                                     | 
|         |                                                                   | 
|   001b  |  The target is capable of supporting the specified peripheral     | 
|         |  device type on this logical unit;  however, the physical device  | 
|         |  is not currently connected to this logical unit.                 | 
|         |                                                                   |

|   011b  |  The target is not capable of supporting a physical device on     | 
|         |  this logical unit. For this peripheral qualifier the peripheral  | 
|         |  device type shall be set to 1Fh to provide compatibility with    | 
|         |  previous versions of SCSI.  All other peripheral device type     | 
|         |  values are reserved for this peripheral qualifier.               |
